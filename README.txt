README

This is a general readme. There are two folders, MazeProgram and RobotProgram.

MazeProgram
The MazeProgram folder stores the code used to generate and solve mazes using various algorithms.
A more detailed README about the programs contained in the folder, and how to setup and run them is provided in the MazeProgram directory.

RobotProgram
The RobotProgram folder stores the code used to by the robot to solve the maze.
It contains the necessary functions to perform line-following and implements the algorithm used to handle different junctions to solve the maze.
It is written in Arduino.

For both programs a thorough and detailed explanation of them has been provided in my report.
